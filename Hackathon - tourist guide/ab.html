<p>The Haji Ali Dargah is a reminder of the multi-cultural roots of Mumbai. It is open to all people irrespective of their faith. It has been braving the seas for over six centuries now and is a beacon of hope for the faithful. Amongst the patron saints of the city, Sayyed Peer Haji Ali Shah has immortalized himself in the city’s sea and its rocks.</p><br>

<p><b>The Dargah Today</b></p>
<br>

<p>Today, Haji Ali Dargah is only accessible via a narrow road that disappears underwater at high tide. The road leads to a carved gateway with a marble façade. The main hall is richly carved with patterns and emblems, keeping the rich Islamic tradition of artistry alive. The ceiling is embedded with intricate pieces of glass with the 99 names of Allah. The main hall holds the tomb of Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. Built in marble and capped with a silver tomb, the tomb is covered with zari cloth and brocade sheets decorated with verses from the Quran.</p><br>

<p>The Sufi tradition rings in the surroundings with Qawwalis being performed regularly in the Qawwal Khana, an adjacent open foyer. An eye-catching 85-foot minaret harks us back to the glory days of Indo-Islamic architecture. This minaret and the bulbous cupola of the dargah in the Worli Bay is one of the most famed views of Mumbai.</p><br>


<p><b>Around The Dargah</b></p><br>

<p>The Haji Ali junction is a major traffic crossover as one heads to South Mumbai from Worli to Kemps Corner, Breach Candy, Malabar Hill and the Mahalakshmi temple. The famously infamous Heera Panna market also stands at this junction. The popular Haji Ali Juice Centre provides respite from Mumbai’s heat. The Haji Ali trust itself runs a sanatorium and several charitable endeavors for the poor, carrying forward the Peer’s work.</p><br>
