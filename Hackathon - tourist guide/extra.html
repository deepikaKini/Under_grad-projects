<p><b>Marine drive, Mumbai Overview</b></p><br>

<p>Marine Drive is a km long, arc shaped boulevard along the South Mumbai coast, starting from the southern end of Nariman Point and ending at the famous Chowpatty beach. The coast lines the Arabian sea and is the best place to watch the sunset in Mumbai, or even to just take a leisurely stroll by the sea any time of the day or night.</p><br>

<p>The Marine Drive is also known as the Queens necklace on account of its shape and yellow streetlights. It makes for a spectacular view at night - you can go to either end of Marine Drive after sunset and see the lights glowing in a perfect arc all along the coast. People come to walk here in the evening to experience the brilliant sunset. It is also one of the places people visit late at night, and you will find vendors selling chai and sutta at all hours. The sound of the waves, a view of the Mumbai skyline and the starry sky easily make Marine Drive one of the most romantic spots in the city.</p><br>


<p><b>Why People Love Marine Drive?</b></p><br>

<p>In the fast-paced life of Mumbai, Marine Drive instils a sense of calm and serenity. The Marine Drive makes the Mumbai monsoons a lot more special as the view from there is spectacular during rains. If you happen to visit during a high tide, you will get splashes of water from the strong waves crashing on the shores below! It is also the perfect place for morning or evening walks. For students from a lot of nearby colleges, this is a favourite hangout spot. It has long been an inspiration for the artists, writers, poets, musicians and photographers, and you would find a lot of movie scenes shot here.</p><br>


<p><b>How to Reach Marine drive</b></p><br>

<p>Marine Drive is probably the most well-identified landmark in Mumbai. You can walk to here from any of the two south-most railway stations - Churchgate or Marine Lines (both are on the Western line). Both of these are less than 5mins of walking distance from here. You can easily take a cab from anywhere as well, and if you happen to be driving, it should be easy to find a parking along the boulevard. There are also a few buses which regularly ply via Marine Drive, for eg the famous double-decker (bus no 138) from CSMT station or bus 123 from Churchgate.</p><br>

<p><p>The Haji Ali Dargah is a reminder of the multi-cultural roots of Mumbai. It is open to all people irrespective of their faith. It has been braving the seas for over six centuries now and is a beacon of hope for the faithful. Amongst the patron saints of the city, Sayyed Peer Haji Ali Shah has immortalized himself in the city’s sea and its rocks.</p><br>
<br>
<p><b>The Dargah Today</b></p>
<br>

<p>Today, Haji Ali Dargah is only accessible via a narrow road that disappears underwater at high tide. The road leads to a carved gateway with a marble façade. The main hall is richly carved with patterns and emblems, keeping the rich Islamic tradition of artistry alive. The ceiling is embedded with intricate pieces of glass with the 99 names of Allah. The main hall holds the tomb of Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. Built in marble and capped with a silver tomb, the tomb is covered with zari cloth and brocade sheets decorated with verses from the Quran.</p><br>
<br>

<p>The Sufi tradition rings in the surroundings with Qawwalis being performed regularly in the Qawwal Khana, an adjacent open foyer. An eye-catching 85-foot minaret harks us back to the glory days of Indo-Islamic architecture. This minaret and the bulbous cupola of the dargah in the Worli Bay is one of the most famed views of Mumbai.</p><br>


<p><b>Around The Dargah</b></p><br>

<p>The Haji Ali junction is a major traffic crossover as one heads to South Mumbai from Worli to Kemps Corner, Breach Candy, Malabar Hill and the Mahalakshmi temple. The famously infamous Heera Panna market also stands at this junction. The popular Haji Ali Juice Centre provides respite from Mumbai’s heat. The Haji Ali trust itself runs a sanatorium and several charitable endeavors for the poor, carrying forward the Peer’s work.</p><br></p>
