Hackathon - Tourist Navigation in Mumbai:
    This website helps tourists travel through places in Mumbai by giving them options for site-seeing, checking out food options by using their 
    location and providing them an itinerary using proximity measures.
    We use Google maps mashup within pages to provide a better picture of where they have to go. 

    Learnings:
      using mashup and location tracking
